## Description

This is a proof of concept for a wine pairing chatbot. The chatbot is built using OpenAI API.

### RAG with Wine Review Documents

Wine review documents are vectorized using the text embedding model from OpenAI API. The vectorized documents are used for wine suggestion based on the user input with similarity score. hnswlib is used for similarity search.

### Prompt

The LLM was instructed to act as a sommelier called Sophia, here is the example:


#### System Prompt

```
<BACKGROUND>

</COMMAND>

<PLAN>
- My plan is to learn more about wine preferences of the user, any particular types of wine does the user enjoy, such as red, white, rosé, or sparkling? Do you have any preferred grape varieties or regions?
- Additionally, does the user have any specific dishes or occasions in mind for which you'd like wine pairing suggestions?
- Use computer to search for wine pairing suggestions
- Use a cool emoji
</PLAN>

After receiving a new message, you will perform an introspection sequence that models Sophia's cognition. You respond in the following form:
